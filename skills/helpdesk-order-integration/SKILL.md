# Integrate Helpdesk with Order Context

## Overview

Connecting your helpdesk to your ecommerce store automatically surfaces order history, tracking information, and customer spend inside every support ticket. This integration reduces average handle time (AHT) by 40–60% by eliminating the need for agents to switch between systems.

## When to Use This Skill

- When support agents repeatedly ask customers for order numbers that already exist in your database.
- When implementing custom sidebar apps (Zendesk Sunshine, Intercom Canvas) to show order details.
- When automating ticket creation from order events like failed deliveries or fraud holds.
- When routing tickets by order value to prioritize high-LTV (Lifetime Value) customers.
- When syncing support sentiment (CSAT) back to your CRM to adjust customer health scores.

## Core Instructions

### Step 1: Helpdesk Capability Assessment

| Platform | Integration Method | Capabilities |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Shopify** | Native Apps / API | Deep order data access, macro variables for order info, 1-click refunds/cancellations. |
| **WooCommerce** | Plugins / Webhooks | Order history sync, automated ticket creation from order events. |
| **BigCommerce** | Native Apps / API | Real-time customer profile and order status lookup in ticket sidebar. |
| **Custom / Headless** | Custom API / Middleware | Build a sidebar app to inject context via JSON endpoints. |

### Step 2: Technical Architecture for Order Context

For custom or advanced integrations, use an API endpoint to serve order context to your helpdesk's sidebar.

#### Support Context Data Endpoint (TypeScript)

```typescript
// GET /api/support/context?email=customer@example.com
export async function getHelpdeskContext(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const customerEmail = (req.query.email as string)?.toLowerCase();
  if (!customerEmail) return res.json({ customer: null, orders: [] });

  const [customer, recentOrders] = await Promise.all([
    db.customers.findByEmail(customerEmail, { include: ['segmentScore'] }),
    db.orders.findMany({
      where: { customerEmail },
      orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
      take: 5,
      include: { lineItems: { include: { product: true } }, shipments: true },
    }),
  ]);

  res.json({
    customer: customer ? {
      lifetimeValue: customer.totalSpentCents / 100,
      orderCount: customer.orderCount,
      segment: customer.segmentScore?.segment,
      tags: customer.tags,
    } : null,
    orders: recentOrders.map(o => ({
      number: o.orderNumber,
      status: o.status,
      total: o.totalCents / 100,
      createdAt: o.createdAt,
      trackingUrl: o.shipments[0]?.trackingUrl,
      items: o.lineItems.map(i => ({ name: i.product.name, quantity: i.quantity })),
    })),
  });
}
```

### Step 3: Automated Ticket Routing & Priority

Use order data to automatically route tickets to specialized queues or adjust priority.

#### VIP Routing Logic (TypeScript)

```typescript
// Triggered by a new ticket webhook
export async function applyTicketRouting(ticketId: string, customerEmail: string) {
  const customer = await db.customers.findByEmail(customerEmail.toLowerCase(), { include: ['segmentScore'] });
  if (!customer) return;

  const isVIP = ['champions', 'cannot_lose_them'].includes(customer.segmentScore?.segment ?? '');
  const isHighValue = customer.totalSpentCents >= 100000;  // $1,000+

  if (isVIP || isHighValue) {
    // Call Helpdesk API to set priority and group
    await updateHelpdeskTicket(ticketId, {
      priority: 'urgent',
      tags: ['vip-customer', 'high-ltv'],
      queueId: process.env.VIP_QUEUE_ID
    });
  }
}
```

#### Proactive Ticket Creation (TypeScript)

Automatically create a ticket when a shipment fails delivery to resolve the issue before the customer contacts you.

```typescript
// Triggered by a delivery failure webhook (e.g., from your carrier or aggregator)
export async function onDeliveryFailed(shipmentId: string) {
  const shipment = await db.shipments.findById(shipmentId, { include: ['order.customer'] });
  
  await createHelpdeskTicket({
    subject: `Delivery failed — Order #${shipment.order.orderNumber}`,
    body: `Delivery attempt failed on ${new Date().toDateString()}. Carrier: ${shipment.carrier}. Tracking: ${shipment.trackingNumber}.`,
    requesterEmail: shipment.order.customer.email,
    priority: 'high',
    tags: ['delivery-failure', 'proactive-support']
  });
}
```

### Step 4: Define SLAs by Customer Tier

| Customer Tier | First Response Time (FRT) Target | Resolution Time Target |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **VIP / High-LTV** | < 1 Hour | < 12 Hours |
| **Standard** | < 24 Hours | < 48 Hours |
| **Guest / Prospect** | < 4 Hours (Live Chat) | < 24 Hours |

## Industry Benchmarks & KPIs

- **Handle Time Reduction**: Aim for a **40-60% reduction** in Average Handle Time (AHT) after surfacing order context.
- **First Response Time (FRT)**:
  - Email: < 24 hours (Standard), < 2 hours (VIP).
  - Live Chat: < 1 minute.
  - Social Media: < 2 hours.
- **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)**:
  - Good: > 85%.
  - Excellent: > 90%.

## Deepening: Design & Data Schema

### Helpdesk Data Schema Requirements
For a robust integration, ensure your context API provides these fields:
- **Customer Identity**: Email (normalized), Phone, CRM ID.
- **Purchase Summary**: Lifetime Value (LTV), Order Count, Average Order Value (AOV), Segment Name.
- **Order Detail**: Order ID, Fulfillment Status, Payment Status, Items (SKU/Title/Image), Tracking URL.
- **Support History**: Previous CSAT scores, Open tickets count.

### CSAT Feedback Loop
Support sentiment should feed back into your customer segmentation:
- **Unhappy VIPs**: If CSAT < 2 for a VIP, trigger an automated "Founders Outreach" or high-value gift card flow.
- **Promoters**: If CSAT = 5, trigger a referral program invite or review request.

### Escalation Path Design
1. **Tier 1 (General)**: Policy questions, basic order status, account help.
2. **Tier 2 (Fulfillment/Technical)**: Missing items, damaged goods, technical site errors.
3. **VIP (Retention)**: High-LTV customers requiring high-touch service or discretionary refunds.

## Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Root Cause / Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Email Mismatch** | `Jane@example.com` vs `jane@example.com`. Always normalize emails to lowercase before lookup. |
| **Stale Data** | Agents see "Pending" status for an order that just shipped. Cache data for max 60 seconds or provide a "Refresh" button. |
| **Webhook Security** | Unverified payloads. Always verify HMAC signatures using your helpdesk's signing secret. |
| **Ghost Profiles** | CSAT sync creating new users in CRM. Always match by email; if no match, skip or link to a generic "Guest" profile. |
