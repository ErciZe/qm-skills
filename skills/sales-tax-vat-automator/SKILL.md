# Sales Tax & VAT Automator

## Overview

Tax compliance in ecommerce is a moving target. With over 13,000 taxing jurisdictions in the US and varying VAT/GST rules globally, manual tax management is impossible at scale. This skill focuses on the technical automation of tax calculation at checkout, the identification of **Economic Nexus**, and the implementation of automated filing and remittance records.

## The Compliance Framework

| Concept | Definition | Trigger |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Physical Nexus** | Tax obligation due to a physical presence (office, warehouse, employee). | First day of operations. |
| **Economic Nexus** | Tax obligation due to sales volume or transaction count in a state. | Usually $100k sales or 200 transactions (varies by state). |
| **Marketplace Facilitator** | Platforms (Amazon, Etsy) that collect and remit tax on your behalf. | Automatic on protected platforms. |
| **OSS / IOSS (EU)** | One-Stop Shop for simplified VAT reporting across EU member states. | > €10,000 in cross-border EU sales. |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Nexus Identification & Threshold Monitoring

Before collecting tax, you must register with the relevant state/country authority.

#### Shopify Admin
1.  Navigate to **Settings > Taxes and Duties > United States**.
2.  **Nexus Tracking:** Shopify automatically tracks your progress toward economic nexus thresholds in every state. Monitor the "Nexus" indicators regularly.
3.  **Registration:** Once a threshold is hit, enter your **Sales Tax ID** to begin collecting.

#### WooCommerce Admin
1.  Ensure **Tax Settings** are enabled in General settings.
2.  For US compliance, use a tax automation service API to pull real-time rates based on the "Ship-to" address. 

### Step 2: Real-Time Tax Calculation (API Implementation)

For custom or headless stores, use a dedicated Tax Engine API to calculate rates at checkout.

```javascript
// Generic Tax Calculation Logic (Node.js)
async function calculateCheckoutTax(orderData) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.tax-engine.com/v2/taxes', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.TAX_API_KEY}` },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      from_country: "US", from_zip: "90210", from_state: "CA",
      to_country: orderData.country, to_zip: orderData.zip, to_state: orderData.state,
      amount: orderData.subtotal,
      shipping: orderData.shipping_cost,
      line_items: orderData.items.map(item => ({
        id: item.sku,
        quantity: item.qty,
        product_tax_code: item.tax_code // e.g., 'Clothing' vs 'Electronics'
      }))
    })
  });
  return await response.json();
}
```

### Step 3: Transaction Committal & Reconcilliation

Calculating tax at checkout is only the first half. You must **commit** the transaction to your tax records after successful payment to ensure your filings are accurate.

- **The Commit Hook:** Trigger a `commit_transaction` call only after the payment status is `succeeded`.
- **The Refund Void:** If an order is returned, you must issue a "Return" or "Void" transaction to the tax engine to prevent over-paying tax.

### Step 4: EU/International VAT Logic (OSS/VIES)

For B2B sales in Europe, you must validate VAT numbers to apply the "Reverse Charge" (0% VAT).

```javascript
// VIES VAT Validation
async function validateVAT(vatNumber) {
  const countryCode = vatNumber.slice(0, 2);
  const number = vatNumber.slice(2);
  const res = await fetch(`https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/rest-api/ms/${countryCode}/vat/${number}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  return data.isValid; // If false, charge local B2C VAT rate.
}
```

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Calculation Accuracy** | 100% (within 0.01 cent of platform reports) |
| **Nexus Monitoring Frequency** | Monthly Review |
| **Audit Readiness** | Historical records kept for 7 years |
| **Filing On-Time Rate** | 100% |

## Decision Criteria: When to Automate Filing

- **Manual Filing:** Best if you have nexus in < 3 states with low transaction volume.
- **Automated Filing:** Essential if you have nexus in > 5 states or are selling in the EU via OSS. The cost of a filing service is significantly lower than the penalty for a single missed or incorrect state return (which can exceed $500 per instance).

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **Product Taxability:** A "T-Shirt" might be tax-exempt in Pennsylvania but taxable in California. Ensure every SKU has a proper **Tax Code** assigned in your product catalog.
- **Shipping Taxability:** Some states tax shipping; others don't. Ensure your tax engine is configured to treat "Shipping" as a separate line item.
- **Marketplace Double-Counting:** If you sell on Amazon AND Shopify, ensure your Shopify reporting excludes Amazon sales to avoid paying tax twice on the same transaction (as Amazon already remitted it).
- **Rounding Discrepancies:** Different platforms use different rounding logic (Round half-up vs. Round to even). Align your tax engine with your ecommerce platform's native rounding to avoid $0.01 discrepancies that prevent reconciliation.
