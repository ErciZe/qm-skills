# Return Policy Designer

## Overview

A return policy is more than a legal document; it is a conversion tool and a financial safeguard. A well-designed policy reduces purchase hesitation while protecting the business from "wardrobing" (buying for one-time use) and excessive logistics costs. This skill focuses on the technical implementation of dynamic policy rules based on product categories, customer segments, and regional compliance.

## Strategic Policy Framework

| Policy Type | Return Window | Restocking Fee | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Standard** | 30 Days | 0% | Apparel, Home Goods (High Trust). |
| **Strict** | 14 Days | 15–20% | High-value Electronics, Perishables. |
| **Final Sale** | 0 Days | N/A | Clearance, Intimates, Personalized items. |
| **VIP Extension** | 60–90 Days | 0% | Loyalty Tier 2+ (Retention Focus). |

### Decision Criteria: Window Length vs. Conversion
- **Longer Windows (60+ days):** Correlate with higher conversion rates as they signal product confidence. Interestingly, they often result in *lower* return rates as the "urgency" to return fades (the Endowment Effect).
- **Shorter Windows (14 days):** Necessary for trend-sensitive items (fast fashion) or items with high depreciation.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Category-Based Rule Configuration

Different products require different guardrails. Use **Product Tags** or **Collections** to drive logic.

#### Shopify Admin
1.  Navigate to **Settings > Policies**. Create your baseline "Refund Policy" text.
2.  **Product-Level Overrides:** Use Metafields or Tags (e.g., `return_window:15`) to store specific rules. 
3.  **Display Logic:** Update your `product.liquid` or JSON template to conditionally show "Non-Returnable" badges if the product has a `final-sale` tag.

#### WooCommerce Admin
1.  Use **Product Categories** to group items.
2.  Apply a global notice to the "Checkout" page using a snippet that checks for "Final Sale" items in the cart and requires an explicit checkbox for "I understand these items are non-returnable."

### Step 2: Regional & Legal Compliance (Edge Cases)

- **EU/UK Right of Withdrawal:** Mandates a minimum 14-day "no questions asked" return window from the date of *delivery*. You must refund the standard outbound shipping cost if the full order is returned.
- **Hygiene Exclusions:** Clearly define "Hygiene Seals." If a seal is broken on beauty or intimate products, the right of return is legally void in most jurisdictions.
- **Holiday Extensions:** Between Nov 1st and Dec 24th, it is industry standard to extend the return window until Jan 31st of the following year. 

### Step 3: Technical Policy Evaluation Logic (API/Custom)

For complex environments, use a programmatic evaluator to determine eligibility.

```typescript
interface PolicyRule {
  category: string;
  windowDays: number;
  restockingFeePct: number;
  isReturnable: boolean;
}

const POLICIES: Record<string, PolicyRule> = {
  'electronics': { category: 'Electronics', windowDays: 15, restockingFeePct: 15, isReturnable: true },
  'apparel': { category: 'Apparel', windowDays: 30, restockingFeePct: 0, isReturnable: true },
  'final-sale': { category: 'Clearance', windowDays: 0, restockingFeePct: 0, isReturnable: false }
};

function getReturnEligibility(productCategory: string, deliveryDate: Date): any {
  const policy = POLICIES[productCategory] || POLICIES['apparel'];
  const daysSinceDelivery = (new Date().getTime() - deliveryDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 3600 * 24);

  if (!policy.isReturnable) return { eligible: false, reason: 'Final Sale' };
  if (daysSinceDelivery > policy.windowDays) return { eligible: false, reason: 'Outside Window' };
  
  return { eligible: true, fee: policy.restockingFeePct };
}
```

### Step 4: Restocking Fee Implementation

Restocking fees should cover the "Reverse Logistics" costs (label + warehouse labor). 
- **Calculated Fee:** Deduct the fee from the `refund_amount` before calling the `POST /orders/{id}/refund` endpoint.
- **Transparency:** Always display the estimated deduction in the return initiation UI to manage customer expectations.

## Benchmarks & Performance Targets

| Indicator | Good | Elite |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Policy Clarity Score** | 80% (Survey) | > 95% |
| **Return-to-Exchange Pivot** | 10% | > 25% |
| **Customer Support Load (Returns)** | < 15% of tickets | < 5% of tickets |
| **Average Processing Time** | 4 Days | < 48 Hours |

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **The "Order Date" Trap:** Calculating the return window from the *Order Date* instead of the *Delivery Date*. This penalizes customers for shipping delays. Always use the `delivered_at` timestamp from your carrier tracking.
- **Hidden Policies:** Hiding the return link in the footer only. **Mitigation:** Include a "Easy Returns" link in the header and on every product page to build trust.
- **Manual Approval Bottlenecks:** Requiring a human to approve every return. **Solution:** Use "Auto-Approval" for all items that fall within the standard window and don't require high-value inspection.
- **Inconsistent Messaging:** Showing "30-day returns" on a banner but "14-day returns" in the policy text. Conduct a "Policy Audit" across all touchpoints (Ads, Email, Site) every quarter.
