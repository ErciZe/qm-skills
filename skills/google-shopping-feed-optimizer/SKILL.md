# Set Up and Optimize Google Shopping Feed

## Overview

Google Merchant Center (GMC) requires a structured product data feed to display products in Shopping ads. Feed quality is the primary ranking factor in Google Shopping. This skill covers account setup, platform-native integration, and optimization strategies for high-performance product listings.

## When to Use This Skill

- When setting up Google Shopping Ads for the first time.
- When products are being disapproved due to missing attributes or data quality issues.
- When price or availability in ads is lagging behind the live website.
- When optimizing product titles to capture more relevant search volume.
- When expanding to multiple countries or currencies.

## Core Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Google Merchant Center Account

1.  **Create Account:** Go to merchants.google.com and sign up.
2.  **Verify & Claim Domain:** Under **Business Information → Website**, verify your domain using a meta tag or file upload.
3.  **Link Google Ads:** Go to **Settings → Linked Accounts → Google Ads** and link your active Ads account.
4.  **Tax and Shipping:** Configure tax and shipping rules natively in GMC under **Shipping and returns** and **Sales tax**.

### Step 2: Platform-Native Integration

#### Shopify
1.  **Channel:** Go to **Shopify Admin → Sales Channels → + → Google & YouTube**.
2.  **Sync:** Connect your GMC account. Shopify automatically syncs attributes (title, price, availability, images, GTIN).
3.  **Audit:** Use the **Google & YouTube → Overview** tab to monitor sync status and fix product-level issues.

#### WooCommerce
1.  **Plugin:** Install the **Google Listings & Ads** plugin (official Google plugin).
2.  **Setup:** Connect your Google account and complete the setup wizard.
3.  **Management:** Products are synced automatically; check **WooCommerce → Google Listings & Ads → Product Feed** for status.

#### Custom / Headless (XML Feed Format)
Generate an XML feed endpoint that Google can crawl. Follow the technical standard:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:g="http://base.google.com/ns/1.0">
  <channel>
    <title>Store Name</title>
    <link>https://example.com</link>
    <item>
      <g:id>SKU123</g:id>
      <g:title>Brand Product Name Color Size</g:title>
      <g:description>Detailed product description...</g:description>
      <g:link>https://example.com/product-url</g:link>
      <g:image_link>https://example.com/image.jpg</g:image_link>
      <g:condition>new</g:condition>
      <g:availability>in_stock</g:availability>
      <g:price>29.99 USD</g:price>
      <g:brand>BrandName</g:brand>
      <g:google_product_category>123</g:google_product_category>
      <g:gtin>01234567890123</g:gtin>
      <g:item_group_id>PARENT_ID</g:item_group_id>
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

### Step 3: Feed Quality Optimization

Feed quality directly impacts your Impression Share and Cost Per Click (CPC).

1.  **Required Fields List:** Ensure every item contains `id`, `title`, `description`, `link`, `image_link`, `availability`, `price`, `brand`, and `gtin`.
2.  **Title Optimization Formula:** Put the most important keywords at the beginning (first 70 characters):
    *   **Formula:** `[Brand] + [Product Name] + [Attribute (Color/Size/Material)] + [Gender/Age Group]`
3.  **Image Requirements:**
    *   Main image must have a plain white background.
    *   Resolution: Minimum 500x500px (1000x1000px recommended).
    *   No promotional text or watermarks.

### Step 4: Multi-Country and GTIN Strategy

#### GTIN Importance Data
Products with valid Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) see up to a **40% increase in impressions**. If a product has a barcode, it is mandatory to provide it in the `gtin` field. For private-label products, set `identifier_exists` to `no`.

#### Multi-Country Feed Strategy
1.  **Primary Feed:** Create a feed for your home market.
2.  **Supplemental Feeds:** Use supplemental feeds to provide translated titles and descriptions for secondary markets.
3.  **Currency Conversion:** Use GMC's built-in currency conversion tool if you don't have local currency product pages.

#### Feed Update Frequency
*   **Static Feeds:** Fetch every 24 hours.
*   **Dynamic Data (Price/Inventory):** Use the **Content API** for real-time updates to prevent price-mismatch disapprovals.

### Step 5: Common Disapproval Reasons

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Price Mismatch | Ensure the feed price exactly matches the Schema.org price on the landing page. |
| Missing Attribute | Add the missing `brand`, `gtin`, or `google_product_category`. |
| Image Too Small | Re-upload images with at least 500x500px resolution. |
| Generic Image | Ensure the main image is a clear product shot on a white background. |
| Landing Page Error | Verify that product URLs do not return 404 or 5xx errors. |

## Best Practices

- **Keyword Research:** Use Google Keyword Planner to find search terms and include them in product titles and descriptions.
- **Supplemental Feeds for Promotions:** Overlay sale prices or custom labels using supplemental feeds instead of modifying the primary feed.
- **Daily Monitoring:** Check the **Diagnostics** tab in GMC daily to catch and fix disapprovals immediately.
- **Custom Labels:** Use `custom_label_0-4` to categorize products by performance (e.g., "Top Seller", "High Margin") for better Ads campaign management.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Identifiers Exist:** Mislabeling products with `identifier_exists: no` when a GTIN actually exists leads to account-level warnings.
- **Stale Data:** Waiting 24 hours for a feed crawl when prices change frequently. Use the Content API for high-velocity changes.
- **Inconsistent Variants:** Not grouping variants under a single `item_group_id`.
