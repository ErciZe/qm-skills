## When to Use
Trigger this skill when a user wants to build thousands of high-quality landing pages automatically. This is ideal for directories, comparison sites, marketplace aggregators, or SaaS tools targeting specific "Noun + Verb" or "City + Service" keyword patterns.

## Core Principles for Quality Scale
Programmatic SEO (pSEO) is not about "spamming" pages. To avoid search engine penalties, follow these 6 principles:
1. **Unique Value per Page**: Every generated page must contain unique data or insights not found on other pages.
2. **Proprietary Data Hierarchy**: Use your own data (e.g., internal database) or unique mashups of public data.
3. **Subfolder Over Subdomain**: Host pSEO pages at `example.com/directory/` rather than `directory.example.com` for better authority flow.
4. **Match Search Intent**: Ensure the template layout matches what the user is looking for (e.g., a "vs" page needs a comparison table, not just a blog post).
5. **Quality over Quantity**: It is better to launch 500 "Gold" pages than 50,000 "Thin" pages.
6. **Internal Linking**: Automated pages must be linked from a crawlable "Hub" or "Sitemap" page.

## The 12 Strategy Playbooks
| Strategy | Pattern Example | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Comparison** | {Brand A} vs {Brand B} | Capturing users in the "Consideration" phase. |
| **Alternatives** | Best {Competitor} Alternatives | Targeting dissatisfied users of a known tool. |
| **Integration** | How to connect {App A} and {App B} | SaaS ecosystem traffic. |
| **Location** | {Service} in {City, State} | Local marketplaces or service providers. |
| **Converter** | Convert {Unit A} to {Unit B} | Utility-based tools (e.g., Currency, Files). |
| **Templates** | {Topic} Template for {Role} | Lead generation via downloadable assets. |
| **Persona** | {Software} for {Industry} | Vertical-specific landing pages. |
| **Glossary** | What is {Technical Term}? | Building top-of-funnel educational authority. |
| **Curated List** | 10 Best {Product Category} | E-commerce listicles. |
| **Directory** | {Category} in {Marketplace} | Aggregating data from a larger ecosystem. |
| **Profile** | {Person/Company} Contact Info | Data-heavy professional directories. |
| **Translation** | {Phrase} in {Language} | Multilingual long-tail capture. |

## Implementation Framework
1. **Keyword Pattern Research**: Identify a high-volume, low-competition pattern (e.g., "How to export {data} from {software}").
2. **Data Sourcing**: Clean and structure your dataset. Ensure fields like `{{brand_name}}`, `{{price}}`, and `{{top_feature}}` are populated.
3. **Template Design**: Create a "Master Template." Use variables for H1, Meta Tags, and Body Content. Include dynamic elements like charts or tables.
4. **Internal Linking Architecture**: Build "Category" or "State" pages to act as parents for the programmatic "Child" pages.
5. **Indexing Strategy**: Use a tiered rollout. Publish 100 pages, monitor indexing, then scale to 1,000+.

## Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] **Canonicity**: Do all pages have a self-referencing canonical tag?
- [ ] **Thin Content Check**: Does the page have at least 300 words of unique, non-templated text?
- [ ] **Page Speed**: Do these pages load in under 2 seconds?
- [ ] **Mobile Layout**: Is the comparison table readable on a mobile screen?
- [ ] **Internal Search**: Can users find these pages via your site's own search bar?

## Success Metrics
- **Indexing Rate**: % of generated pages indexed by Google within 30 days.
- **Organic Impressions**: Growth in the "Long-Tail" keyword cluster.
- **Average Position**: Are we ranking in the top 10 for the targeted patterns?
- **Conversion Rate**: Are these high-volume pages actually driving sign-ups or sales?
