# Etsy POD Store Automation Skill

This skill provides a complete operational playbook for running a profitable Print-on-Demand store on Etsy using Printify as the fulfillment provider. It distills hard-won lessons from real store operations into repeatable, automated workflows.

## Quick Reference

| Resource | Path |
|---|---|
| Product Creation API Guide | `references/printify-api.md` |
| SEO & Tag Generation | `references/seo-tags.md` |
| Social Media Playbook | `references/social-media.md` |
| Performance & Optimization | `references/performance.md` |

Read the relevant reference file before executing that workflow. Each contains step-by-step API calls, code templates, and critical rules.

## Core Principles

1. **Tags are everything.** Etsy's search algorithm matches buyer queries to listing tags. A listing with 0 tags gets 0 search traffic — no exceptions. Every product must launch with 13 carefully chosen tags.

2. **Photos drive conversion.** Some product types (e.g. posters) get many auto-mockups from Printify, but others (e.g. mugs) may get only 1. Listings with fewer than 2 photos are penalized by Etsy's search visibility algorithm. Target 5+ photos for best results.

3. **Margins before volume.** Start with the highest-margin, lowest-return-risk products. A single return can wipe out profit from 3-5 sales. Avoid sizing-dependent products (apparel) until you have a revenue buffer.

4. **Think timing, not just product.** Create seasonal products 4-6 weeks before peak buying windows. Father's Day products in May, not June.

5. **Self-improving loop.** Every week: retire the bottom 20% of listings, create more variations of the top 20%, and update tags/titles based on actual search data.

## Store Setup & Configuration

Before using this skill, ensure:

- [ ] Etsy seller account is active
- [ ] Printify account is connected to the Etsy shop
- [ ] Printify API token is stored in `project/.env` as `PRINTIFY_API_TOKEN`
- [ ] Printify Shop ID is known (find via `GET https://api.printify.com/v1/shops.json`)

### First-Time Setup

On first use, the agent should:

1. **Discover the shop** — call `GET /v1/shops.json` to find the Shop ID
2. **Browse the Printify catalog** — call `GET /v1/catalog/blueprints.json` to see all available product types
3. **Choose product types** — for each chosen blueprint, call `GET /v1/catalog/blueprints/{id}/print_providers.json` to find providers, then `GET /v1/catalog/blueprints/{id}/print_providers/{pid}/variants.json` to get variant IDs and base costs
4. **Set pricing** — calculate retail prices using the pricing formula below
5. **Save configuration** — persist Shop ID, chosen blueprints, variant IDs, and pricing to the agent's MEMORY.md

### Pricing Formula

Use this formula to set profitable prices:

```
Retail Price = (Production Cost + Shipping Cost) / (1 - Target Margin - Etsy Fee Rate)

Where:
  Production Cost = Printify base cost for the variant
  Shipping Cost   = Printify shipping cost (or $0 if offering free shipping built into price)
  Target Margin   = Your desired net profit margin (recommended: 40-60%)
  Etsy Fee Rate   = ~0.12 (listing fee + 6.5% transaction + 3% + $0.25 payment processing ≈ 10-12%)
```

**Example:** A mug costs $5.95 to produce. With 50% target margin:
`$5.95 / (1 - 0.50 - 0.12) = $5.95 / 0.38 ≈ $15.66` → round to $15.99 or $16.99

**Pricing tips:**
- Use .99 endings (psychological pricing)
- Check competitor pricing on Etsy for similar products before setting yours
- Consider offering free shipping (Etsy algorithm rewards this) — build shipping cost into the price
- Start competitive (lower margin) to build initial reviews, then raise prices

## Workflows

### 1. Product Creation (read `references/printify-api.md`)

The end-to-end flow for creating a new product:

```
Trend/Idea → AI Design → Upload to Printify → Create Product (with 13 tags!) → Publish to Etsy
```

**Critical rules:**
- **Always include 13 SEO tags** when creating products (read `references/seo-tags.md` for the tag generation algorithm)
- Use the structured title format: `Product Name: Key Descriptors, Use Case, Style`
- Front-load the most important keyword in the first 40 characters (mobile truncation)
- Set prices using the pricing formula above — look up production costs via Printify API
- Consider offering free shipping (built into price) — Etsy algorithm rewards this

### 2. SEO & Tag Optimization (read `references/seo-tags.md`)

Tags are the #1 factor for Etsy search visibility. The skill includes a complete tag generation algorithm that creates 13 context-aware tags per product using the "3-8 split" strategy:
- 3-4 broad tags (high volume)
- 8-9 long-tail tags (high conversion, lower competition)

Tags should cover: product type, style/aesthetic, occasion/gift, room/placement, season, and trending terms.

### 3. Photo Management

**Check auto-mockup counts per product type.** Some Printify products generate many mockup photos (e.g. posters ~20), while others generate very few (e.g. mugs ~1). For products with fewer than 2 auto-mockups:

- Generate lifestyle photos via `image_generate`
- Upload them directly to Etsy via the listing editor using the JavaScript injection technique (the Printify `images` field only accepts auto-generated mockup references, not custom uploads)

Read `references/printify-api.md` for the exact JS code and browser workflow.

### 4. Social Media Promotion (read `references/social-media.md`)

Every product post MUST include:
- An actual product mockup image (not generic/stock photos)
- A direct link to the specific Etsy listing
- Only promote products confirmed in real inventory

Supported platforms:
- **Twitter/X:** via `post_tweet` MCP tool with `media_urls` parameter
- **Instagram:** via Composio two-step API (create container → publish)
- **Pinterest:** via browser automation "Save from URL" approach

### 5. Performance Monitoring (read `references/performance.md`)

Daily check of:
- Etsy stats page (visits, views, orders, revenue, traffic sources)
- Etsy search visibility page (recommendations, warnings)
- Printify orders API (fulfillment status)

Weekly review:
- Retire bottom 20% listings (0 views after 14 days)
- Scale top 20% (create variations, new product types)
- Update tags/titles based on search data

### 6. Trend Research

Use a combination of:
- **Google Trends** (via Apify scraper or web search) — weekly deep dive
- **Etsy trending searches** (via `sovereigntaylor/etsy-scraper` Apify actor) — daily
- **Instagram/TikTok** (via Apify scrapers) — daily for visual trends
- **Pinterest** — weekly for home decor trends

Score each trend using the 5-factor framework:
| Factor | Weight |
|---|---|
| Search volume / engagement | 25% |
| Growth velocity | 25% |
| Etsy competition level | 20% |
| Printify feasibility | 15% |
| Longevity estimate | 15% |

Action thresholds: ≥4.0 → create immediately, 3.0-3.9 → queue, <3.0 → monitor only.

## Product Risk Tiers

| Tier | Products | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **LAUNCH** (start here) | Posters, mugs, stickers | No sizing risk, high margin, standard fulfillment |
| **MONITOR** (add after 20+ sales) | Tote bags, phone cases, keychains | Good margin but lower demand or device-fit risk |
| **AVOID** (until profitable) | T-shirts, hoodies, blankets | Sizing returns will kill margins; high COGS per return |

---

## Seasonal Calendar

Plan product creation 4-6 weeks ahead of these dates:

| Date | Event | Products to Create |
|---|---|---|
| Feb 14 | Valentine's Day | Love/heart/couple themed |
| Mar 17 | St. Patrick's Day | Irish/green/clover |
| Apr (varies) | Easter | Bunny/egg/spring pastels |
| May (2nd Sun) | Mother's Day | Mom/floral/family |
| May (varies) | Nurses/Teachers Week | Appreciation humor |
| Jun (3rd Sun) | Father's Day | Dad/masculine/humor |
| Jul 4 | Independence Day | Patriotic/americana |
| Oct 31 | Halloween | Spooky/gothic/harvest |
| Nov (4th Thu) | Thanksgiving | Gratitude/autumn |
| Dec 25 | Christmas | Holiday/winter/gifts |
| Year-round | Birthdays | Birth flowers (12 months) |
| Year-round | Graduation | Class of [Year] |

## Automation Schedule (Cron Jobs)

The recommended daily/weekly schedule (adjust times to your timezone):

| Time | Task | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Daily morning | Trend Scan | Instagram, TikTok, Etsy trending search |
| Daily mid-morning | Product Creation | Generate designs, create via API, publish |
| Daily noon | Social Media | Twitter + Instagram + Pinterest posts |
| Daily afternoon | Search Visibility | Check Etsy tips, fix titles/photos/tags |
| Daily evening | Performance Monitor | Views, favorites, orders, returns |
| Weekly (Mon) | Competitor Analysis | Scrape top sellers, compare pricing |
| Weekly (Wed) | Google Trends | Rising queries, breakout trends |
| Weekly (Fri) | Weekly Review | Retire bottom 20%, scale top 20% |

---

## Financial Framework

### Cost Structure Per Sale
| Component | How to Calculate |
|---|---|
| Printify production | Look up via `GET /v1/catalog/blueprints/{id}/print_providers/{pid}/variants.json` |
| Printify shipping | Look up via print provider shipping info |
| Etsy listing fee | $0.20 per listing (renewed every 4 months or on sale) |
| Etsy transaction fee | 6.5% of item price + shipping |
| Etsy payment processing | 3% + $0.25 per transaction |
| **Total Etsy overhead** | **~10-12% of price** |

### Key Metrics Targets
| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Conversion rate | 2-3% (new shops may see 1-2%) |
| Return rate | <2% (action trigger: pause category at >3%) |
| Etsy search traffic % | 40-60% of total (may be 0% for first 1-3 weeks) |

### Profit Calculation

```
Net Profit = Retail Price - Production Cost - Shipping Cost - Etsy Fees
Etsy Fees  = $0.20 + (6.5% × Price) + (3% × Price) + $0.25
           ≈ $0.45 + 9.5% × Price
```

Use the Printify API to look up exact production costs per variant before setting prices.

## Common Pitfalls (Learned the Hard Way)

1. **Forgetting tags entirely** — Mass product creation scripts often omit tags. Always verify every product has 13 tags before considering it "done." This single mistake caused 0% search traffic on a 110-listing store.

2. **Etsy's AI title recommendations are often wrong** — It may suggest renaming posters as "mugs" or vice versa. Review recommendations carefully; don't blindly accept.

3. **Browser upload limitations** — Cannot upload files directly to Etsy via browser automation (sandbox restriction). Must use JS `fetch()` + `DataTransfer` + `FileList` injection.

4. **Printify `images` field** — Only accepts auto-generated mockup references, not custom uploaded images. Custom photos must go through Etsy's listing editor directly.

5. **Rate limits everywhere** — Printify API ~100 req/min on catalog endpoints. Twitter ~3 tweets per burst. Instagram two-step process. Pinterest SPA causes browser loops — use "Save from URL" approach.

6. **New shop indexing delay** — Etsy search traffic may be 0% for the first 1-3 weeks. This is normal. Don't panic — focus on social media traffic to signal quality.

7. **Etsy Ads waiting period** — New shops must wait ~15 days before Etsy Ads are available. Plan accordingly.

8. **Not checking production costs** — Printify costs vary significantly by print provider and variant. Always look up actual costs via the API before setting prices, rather than assuming fixed amounts.
